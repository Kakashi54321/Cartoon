: ASP.NET - Intro to Web Forms, Web Controls, Master Pages, State Management Techniques
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEB FORMS:-
	rich web user interface
	styling,controls,javascript
	seperation of client and server(runat= "server")
	state execution (in html it cannot store the web pages, cookies or anything, cannot access data from database)
	Event-Driven Programming Language(all controls will have events like onload,onclick,onhover)
	State Management(temporarily store the data of page)- client and server
	Browser independent
	
Features of ASP.NET WEB Forms:-
	Server Controls
	Master Pages
	security
	Debugging and Error Handling
	Deployment & Hosting(eg- IIS server)
	
State Management Techniques:-
	1)Client side:-
		View state(save the entire page with single page application and can be redirected)
		Hiddden Fields(we can save any data untill it is redirected)
		Query String(?type=demo)
		Cookies(Store data for specific period of time)
	2) Server Side:-
		Application state(contains all the data that we have provided and can be accessed anywhere from the application)
							will start when hosting website on IIS server or any server and stop only when website is  stopped.
		Session state(Eg- login and logout)
						store and retrieve data of all the pages and use it anytime

Master Page:-
	Master Page is use to write or design layout of the page one time and when you will inherit the master page to other pages 
	it will directly show you the layout of the page as it is in master page
	Imagine you have 20 to 25 web forms than without master page you will have to design all the page layout one by one and 
	if there is any change in that than you will have to go in all the pages for change
	but with master page its not the case. if you will make change in master page
	than it will directly get change in all the pages because all other page inherit master page					
 	
Session :-
	Session["Name"] = txtName.Text;
	Session["Name"] in which "Name" is the key of session with the help of it you will able to retrieve and store data in that particular session 
	txtName.Text is an ASP.Net web control of TextBox which value is been stored in session
